## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I fixed the following:

* Add references in the DESCRIPTION
* Replaces \dontrun{} with \donttest{} for the example of clust_cp_epi. The reason is that it takes more than 5 seconds to run. 

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
